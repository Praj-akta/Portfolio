          Hello! Iâ€™m Prajakta Limje, a passionate Frontend Software Developer with a strong commitment

          frameworks, including <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>,{" "}

          maintainable, and efficient code.
          <br /> <br />
          My expertise spans from designing{" "}
          <strong>responsive, mobile-first web applications</strong> to
          optimizing <strong>cross-browser compatibility</strong>, ensuring that
          every user interaction is smooth and seamless across devices and
          platforms. I am also experienced in integrating <strong>APIs</strong>,

          functionality and performance, and I prioritize{" "}
          <strong>performance optimization</strong> to deliver faster and more
          efficient applications.
          <br /> <br />

          including working with databases like <strong>MySQL</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>Firebase</strong>, as well as{" "}
          <strong>cloud technologies</strong> such as <strong>AWS</strong>, I
          bridge the gap between front-end and back-end systems to create
          comprehensive, scalable solutions. I am also deeply committed to
          maintaining high-quality code through <strong>unit testing</strong>{" "}
          and <strong>end-to-end testing</strong>, ensuring stability and
          reliability in every project. Driven by a passion for{" "}
          <strong>problem-solving</strong> and{" "}
